# Photon Roadmap ðŸš€

**Status**: Draft - Will be finalized as part of rebrand (User Story 4)  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-10

> **Photon**: A modern ES6+ JavaScript library for programmatically creating precise 2D drawings for CNC machines and laser cutters. Resurrected from Microsoft's Maker.js with modern tooling, active maintenance, and exceptional user experience.

## Vision

Photon will be the **go-to library** for makers, hobbyists, and professionals who want to programmatically generate precise 2D designs for fabrication. We prioritize:

- **Modern JavaScript**: Full ES6+ support, modern tooling
- **User Experience**: Welcoming, experiment-friendly, answers always within reach
- **Precision**: CNC/laser-grade accuracy and industry-standard formats
- **Community**: Open, collaborative, responsive to user needs

## Near-Term (3-6 months) - Foundation

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Monaco Editor integration (VS Code-like experience)
- [x] ES6+ syntax support in playground
- [x] Project constitution established
- [x] TypeScript 5.x upgrade

### ðŸŽ¯ In Progress
- [ ] **Rebrand to Photon** (Current focus - see specs/001-rebrand-from-maker/)
  - Core identity and legal attribution
  - Documentation and web presence

  - Export preview before download
  - Mobile-responsive design improvements
  - Dark mode support
  - Ability to import multiple models into a space and chain them together
  - Operations/Color support for paths within models (most lasers support distinct colors of paths as distinct operations with differing speed/power settings)

- [ ] **Documentation Overhaul**
  - Interactive examples in every doc page
  - Video tutorials for common patterns
  - Searchable API reference
  - Beginner-friendly quick start guide
  - Advanced patterns cookbook

## Mid-Term (6-12 months) - Growth

- [ ] **Enhanced Export Formats**
  - G-code generation for CNC
  - Improved DXF with layer support
  - PDF with multiple pages
  - PNG/JPEG raster export with anti-aliasing
  - .3mf style file that includes multiple SVG's for laser cutting along with a markdown file that describes the project and can work as labnotes for makers.

- [ ] **Material & Tool Libraries**
  - Pre-configured settings for common materials
  - Tool compensation presets
  - Kerf adjustment calculator
  - Feed rate recommendations

### Community Building
- [ ] **Community Gallery**

  - Clear contribution guidelines
  - Good first issue labels
  - Mentorship program for new contributors
  - Regular community calls

## Long-Term (1-2 years) - Innovation

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **3D Extrusion & Visualization**
  - Preview 3D extrusions from 2D paths
  - STL import/export improvements
  - WebGL-based 3D viewer
  - Assembly modeling (multiple parts)

- [ ] **AI-Assisted Design**
  - Natural language to design ("create a gear with 20 teeth")
  - Design optimization suggestions
  - Automatic constraint solving
  - Pattern recognition and completion

- [ ] **Collaborative Features**
  - Real-time collaborative editing
  - Design versioning and history
  - Comments and annotations
  - Team workspaces

### Platform Expansion
- [ ] **Desktop Application**

  - Simple editing on tablets
  - AR preview (hold phone over material)
  - Remote monitoring of cuts

- [ ] **Cloud Services** (Optional)
  - Design storage and sync
  - Render farm for complex operations
  - API for programmatic access
  - Integration with fabrication services

### Ecosystem
- [ ] **Photon Studio** (Visual Editor)
  - Drag-and-drop interface for non-coders
  - Code generation from visual designs
  - Hybrid visual + code workflow
  - Template marketplace

- [ ] **Hardware Partnerships**
  - Verified compatibility with popular machines
  - Direct export to machine software
  - Material libraries from suppliers
  - Educational partnerships (makerspaces, schools)

## What Makes Photon Different

### From Maker.js (Original)
- âœ… **Active Maintenance**: Regular updates, bug fixes, community support
- âœ… **Modern Tooling**: Monaco Editor, ES6+, modern build system
- âœ… **Better UX**: Welcoming playground, clear docs, helpful errors
- âœ… **Community-Driven**: Open governance, responsive to user needs

### From Other CAD Tools
- **Programmatic**: Code-first approach for parametric designs
- **Lightweight**: Runs in browser, no installation required
- **Open Source**: Free, transparent, extensible
- **CNC-Focused**: Built specifically for fabrication, not general CAD
- **JavaScript**: Accessible to web developers, huge ecosystem

## Success Metrics

We'll measure Photon's success by:

- **Adoption**: npm downloads, GitHub stars, community size
- **Quality**: Test coverage, bug resolution time, documentation completeness
- **Performance**: Bundle size, operation speed, playground responsiveness
- **Community**: Contributors, plugins, gallery submissions
- **Impact**: Designs created, machines supported, educational use
