title: Open Vs Closed Geometry
---
An open geometry is when any path in a drawing is a dead end. A closed geometry is when all path ends meet and there are no dead end paths. A closed geometry forms an enclosed shape.

Examples of Open Geometry:

Examples of Closed Geometry:

Maker.js works with both open and closed geometries. When your desire is to create a three dimensional object, you will probably be using a closed geometry.
