# Specification Quality Checklist: Rebrand to Photon

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

### Content Quality Review
- Specification focuses on WHAT needs to be rebranded (package names, documentation, attribution) without specifying HOW to implement
- User stories clearly articulate value for maintainers, new users, existing users, and contributors
- Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Review
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete
- Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-018) is testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria include specific, measurable metrics (100% package names, zero broken links, 15-minute migration time)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on outcomes, not implementation)
- All 4 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases identified (URL redirects, npm conflicts, backward compatibility, SEO, legal concerns)
- Scope clearly bounded to rebrand activities (not feature additions)
- Assumptions documented (npm availability, version strategy, repository location)

### Feature Readiness Review
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios cover all primary flows: core identity, documentation, migration, roadmap
- Success criteria directly measure the functional requirements
- No implementation leakage - spec doesn't prescribe tools, languages, or technical approaches

## Notes

This specification is **READY FOR PLANNING** (`/speckit.plan`).

The specification successfully balances comprehensiveness with clarity. It provides enough detail for implementation planning while remaining technology-agnostic. The three user stories are properly prioritized (P1: Core Identity → P2: Documentation & Roadmap) and independently testable, enabling incremental delivery.

**Scope Update**: Migration guide removed based on minimal Maker.js usage analysis. Brief migration notes included in README instead (FR-011). Focus shifted to attracting new users rather than migrating existing ones.

Key strengths:
- Clear legal/attribution requirements (Apache 2.0 compliance)
- Realistic edge cases identified early
- Measurable success criteria that can be verified
- Proper prioritization enabling MVP approach (P1 alone delivers functional rebrand)
- Pragmatic scope adjustment based on actual usage data
