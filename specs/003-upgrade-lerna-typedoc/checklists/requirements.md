# Specification Quality Checklist: Upgrade Lerna & TypeDoc to Latest Versions

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks completed successfully

### Details

**Content Quality**: All checks passed

- Specification focuses on WHAT (upgrade dependencies) and WHY (security, compatibility, maintainability)
- No implementation details about how to perform the upgrade
- Written in business terms understandable by project maintainers and stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: All checks passed

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are specific and clear
- All 12 functional requirements are testable (can verify version numbers, run scripts, check security audits)
- All 8 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (version numbers, exit codes, timing, audit results)
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes (workflows work, tests pass, no vulnerabilities) rather than implementation
- 4 prioritized user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios cover all upgrade aspects
- 5 edge cases identified for boundary conditions
- Scope boundaries clearly define what is and isn't included
- Dependencies and assumptions explicitly documented

**Feature Readiness**: All checks passed

- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios progress from P1 (critical: security & compatibility) through P3 (nice-to-have: new features)
- Success criteria provide measurable validation that the feature is complete
- Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout

## Recommendation

✅ **PROCEED TO PLANNING** - This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or can be clarified further with `/speckit.clarify` if needed.

The specification is well-structured, complete, and provides clear guidance for implementation without prescribing technical solutions.
