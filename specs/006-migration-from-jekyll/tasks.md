# Tasks: Documentation Migration from Jekyll to MkDocs

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-migration-from-jekyll/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ, quickstart.md ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Playwright tests are included as requested in User Story 4 (P4)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Migration scripts**: `scripts/migration/`
- **New MkDocs site**: `docs-new/`
- **Playwright tests**: `tests/docs-migration/`
- **Old Jekyll site**: `docs/` (to be archived after migration)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (P2): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories (but logically follows US1)
  - User Story 3 (P3): Depends on User Story 2 (needs migrated content to build navigation and update links)
  - User Story 4 (P4): Depends on User Stories 1-3 (needs working site with content to test)
- **Validation (Phase 7)**: Depends on User Stories 1-3 completion
- **Content Refactoring (Phase 8)**: Depends on User Story 2 completion (needs migrated content) - MUST complete before AI Enhancement
- **AI Enhancement (Phase 9)**: Depends on Phase 8 completion (needs refactored content with photon/core references)
- **Cleanup (Phase 10)**: Depends on all validation passing and Phase 9 completion
- **Documentation (Phase 11)**: Depends on cleanup completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Script Creation)

```bash
# Launch all script creation tasks together:
Task T020: "Create snippet_converter.py in scripts/migration/"
Task T021: "Create page_converter.py in scripts/migration/"
Task T022: "Create frontmatter_mapper.py in scripts/migration/"
Task T023: "Create liquid_tag_converter.py in scripts/migration/"

# These can all be developed in parallel since they're different files
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 4 (Test Creation)

```bash
# Launch all test file creation tasks together:
Task T043: "Create visual-verification.spec.js in tests/docs-migration/"
Task T044: "Create navigation.spec.js in tests/docs-migration/"
Task T045: "Create content-rendering.spec.js in tests/docs-migration/"
Task T046: "Create search.spec.js in tests/docs-migration/"
Task T047: "Create accessibility.spec.js in tests/docs-migration/"

# Then implement all tests in parallel:

Task T049: "Implement navigation.spec.js tests"
Task T050: "Implement content-rendering.spec.js tests"
Task T051: "Implement search.spec.js tests"
Task T052: "Implement accessibility.spec.js tests"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test MkDocs build and serve independently
5. Demo working MkDocs site with theme

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo working MkDocs site (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo migrated content
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo complete navigation
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo automated testing
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (MkDocs setup)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 scripts (migration scripts)
3. After US1 and US2 scripts ready:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (navigation and links)
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (Playwright tests)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Migration scripts output JSON for tracking and validation
- Keep Jekyll site archived for 6 months as rollback option
- All file paths are absolute from repository root
