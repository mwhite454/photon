# Baseline Warning Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-16

This report summarizes the initial state of MkDocs build warnings captured on this date. The analysis provides a clear, data-driven foundation for prioritizing our remediation efforts.

## Key Findings

- **Total Warnings**: 505
- **Remediation Target**: <150 (a 70%+ reduction)

## Warning Distribution by Category

The overwhelming majority of warnings are related to broken links, making this the highest-impact area for remediation.

| Category | Count | Percentage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `broken_link` | 420 | 83.2% |
| `plugin_warning` | 81 | 16.0% |
| `file_conflict` | 3 | 0.6% |
| `config_warning` | 1 | 0.2% |

## Next Steps

Based on this analysis, the remediation strategy will be as follows:

1.  **Priority 1: Broken Links**: Address all 420 `broken_link` warnings to immediately improve documentation usability.
2.  **Priority 2: Plugin Warnings**: Investigate the 81 `plugin_warning` issues to ensure our build process is stable and future-proof.
3.  **Priority 3: File & Config**: Resolve the remaining `file_conflict` and `config_warning` issues.

This phased approach ensures we tackle the most critical user-facing issues first.
