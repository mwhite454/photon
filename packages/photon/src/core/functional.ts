/**
 * Pipe value through functions left-to-right
 * 
 * Applies functions in sequence from left to right, passing the result
 * of each function to the next. This is a pure functional composition
 * utility that does not mutate the original value.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Simple numeric transformations
 * const result = pipe(
 *   10,
 *   x => x + 5,
 *   x => x * 2,
 *   x => x - 3
 * ); // 27
 * 
 * // With Photon models
 * const square = pipe(
 *   new Square(100),
 *   m => model.moveRelative(m, [10, 20]),
 *   m => model.rotate(m, 45)
 * );
 * ```
 * 
 * @param value - Initial value to transform
 * @param fns - Functions to apply in sequence (left-to-right)
 * @returns Final result after all transformations
