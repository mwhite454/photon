# Feature Specification: Upgrade Lerna & TypeDoc to Latest Versions

**Feature Branch**: `003-upgrade-lerna-typedoc`  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "upgrade Lerna & typedoc to the latest versions"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Dependency Security Updates (Priority: P1)

As a project maintainer, I need the monorepo tooling to use the latest stable versions of Lerna and TypeDoc so that the project benefits from security patches, bug fixes, and performance improvements that have been released since the current versions.

**Why this priority**: Security vulnerabilities in dependencies pose the highest risk to the project and its users. This is the most critical aspect of keeping dependencies current.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by installing the upgraded dependencies, running the existing build process, and verifying no security vulnerabilities are reported by npm audit or similar tools.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the project uses Lerna 6.0.3, **When** dependencies are upgraded, **Then** Lerna is updated to the latest stable version (8.x or higher)
2. **Given** the project uses TypeDoc 0.26.0, **When** dependencies are upgraded, **Then** TypeDoc is updated to the latest stable version (0.26.x or higher)
3. **Given** dependencies are upgraded, **When** running npm audit, **Then** no high or critical vulnerabilities are reported for Lerna or TypeDoc

### User Story 2 - Build Process Repair & Compatibility (Priority: P1)

As a developer working on the project, I need the broken build processes (TypeDoc documentation generation, TypeScript compilation in demos/fonts packages) to be fixed as part of the upgrade so that the development workflow becomes fully functional and the dependency upgrade can be properly validated.

**Why this priority**: The build process is currently broken with pre-existing issues that prevent proper validation of the upgrade. These issues must be fixed to ensure the upgrade is successful and the project is in a working state.

**Pre-existing Issues to Fix**:

- TypeDoc documentation generation fails due to entry points not being referenced in tsconfig
- TypeScript compilation errors in demos and fonts packages due to @types/node Buffer interface incompatibility
- Build process cannot be validated because it fails in both baseline and post-upgrade states

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running all npm scripts (`npm run bootstrap`, `npm run build`, `npm run docs`, `npm test`) and verifying they complete successfully with exit code 0.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** dependencies are upgraded, **When** running `npm run bootstrap`, **Then** all packages in the monorepo are successfully linked
2. **Given** TypeDoc configuration is fixed, **When** running `npm run docs`, **Then** API documentation is generated successfully without errors
3. **Given** TypeScript compilation issues are resolved, **When** running `npm run build`, **Then** all packages (including demos and fonts) compile without errors
4. **Given** all build processes are fixed, **When** running `npm test`, **Then** all tests pass with exit code 0
5. **Given** the build is working, **When** comparing to baseline, **Then** the upgrade has not introduced any new failures

### User Story 3 - Configuration Migration (Priority: P2)

As a project maintainer, I need any deprecated configuration options or breaking changes to be identified and updated so that the project uses modern best practices and remains maintainable going forward.

**Why this priority**: While important for long-term maintainability, configuration updates can be done after confirming the upgrades work with existing configuration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reviewing the changelogs for Lerna and TypeDoc, identifying breaking changes, updating relevant configuration files, and verifying builds complete successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Lerna has breaking changes between v6 and latest, **When** reviewing lerna.json, **Then** all deprecated options are updated or removed
2. **Given** TypeDoc has breaking changes between v0.26 and latest, **When** reviewing TypeDoc configuration, **Then** all deprecated options are updated or removed
3. **Given** configuration files are updated, **When** running documentation generation, **Then** no deprecation warnings appear in the output

---

### User Story 4 - New Features Access (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want access to new features and improvements introduced in the latest versions of Lerna and TypeDoc so that I can leverage modern tooling capabilities for better productivity.

**Why this priority**: New features are beneficial but not critical. The primary goal is maintaining existing functionality with updated versions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reviewing release notes for new features, identifying applicable enhancements, and optionally implementing one or two improvements to validate they work.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the latest versions are installed, **When** reviewing release notes, **Then** a list of new features available to the project is documented
2. **Given** new features are available, **When** optional enhancements are implemented, **Then** they integrate smoothly with the existing project structure

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Lerna introduces breaking changes to the bootstrap command syntax?
- What happens when TypeDoc changes output structure or theming APIs?
- How does the system handle if Lerna or TypeDoc require a higher version of Node.js than currently used?
- What happens if npm scripts that invoke Lerna or TypeDoc need parameter adjustments?
- How are peer dependencies handled if Lerna or TypeDoc require specific versions of other tools?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST upgrade Lerna from version 6.0.3 to the latest stable major version
- **FR-002**: System MUST upgrade TypeDoc from version 0.26.0 to the latest stable minor/patch version within 0.26.x series or to latest 0.x series if no breaking changes
- **FR-003**: System MUST fix TypeDoc configuration so that documentation generation completes successfully
- **FR-003a**: System MUST fix TypeScript compilation errors in demos and fonts packages
- **FR-003b**: System MUST ensure all packages in the monorepo build successfully
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain all existing documentation generation functionality and fix pre-existing failures
- **FR-005**: System MUST update package.json with new dependency versions
- **FR-006**: System MUST update package-lock.json or equivalent lock file with resolved dependencies
