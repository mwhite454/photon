# Tasks: MkDocs Warning Remediation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/009-mkdocs-excessive-warnings/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: No automated tests requested - validation will be done through MkDocs build verification and content audits

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each warning category.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Documentation**: `docs/` directory containing markdown files
- **Scripts**: `scripts/docs-warnings/` for Python automation scripts
- **Reports**: `reports/baselines/`, `reports/docs-warnings/`, `reports/tests/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and baseline capture

- [x] T001 Create directory structure for scripts and reports (scripts/docs-warnings/, reports/baselines/, reports/docs-warnings/, reports/tests/)
- [x] T002 [P] Create markdownlint configuration file .markdownlint.json at repository root
- [x] T003 [P] Verify Python dependencies in requirements.txt (subprocess, re, json, pathlib, BeautifulSoup)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No warning remediation work can begin until baseline is captured and categorization is complete

- [x] T004 Create warning capture script in scripts/docs-warnings/capture-warnings.py
- [x] T005 Create warning parsing functions with regex patterns for categorization (broken_link, missing_reference, syntax_error, plugin_warning, config_warning)
- [x] T006 Create baseline report generation function in scripts/docs-warnings/capture-warnings.py
- [x] T007 Run baseline capture and generate reports/baselines/warning-baseline.json
- [x] T008 [P] Create progress report generation script in scripts/docs-warnings/analyze-warnings.py
- [x] T009 [P] Create content audit script in scripts/docs-warnings/audit-content.py for tracking word counts, heading counts, link counts
- [ ] T010 Commit baseline report and scripts with message "feat: capture baseline of MkDocs warnings"

**Checkpoint**: Baseline established - warning remediation can now begin in parallel by category

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Warning Baseline and Categorization (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Understand the current state of MkDocs warnings through structured capture, categorization, and baseline reporting

**Independent Test**: Run MkDocs build, verify all warnings are captured in JSON report with categories, counts, and percentages. Baseline report should show 500+ warnings with distribution across categories.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T015 [US1] Document baseline findings in reports/docs-warnings/baseline-analysis.md
- [ ] T016 [US1] Commit analysis with message "docs: document baseline warning analysis and categorization"

**Checkpoint**: At this point, we have complete understanding of warning landscape and can prioritize remediation efforts

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
  - US2, US3, US4 can proceed in parallel if desired (different warning categories)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from other stories
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from other stories
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Validation/analysis scripts before manual fixes
- Fixes in small batches with testing after each batch
- Progress reports after each batch of fixes
- Commit after each logical group of fixes

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, US2, US3, and US4 can work in parallel (different warning categories)
- Within each user story, validation and reporting tasks can run in parallel
- Polish phase validation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Broken Links)

```bash
# After link validation script is ready:
# Fix broken links in different documentation sections in parallel:
Task: "Fix broken API documentation links in docs/docs/snippets/models.md"
Task: "Fix broken cross-references in docs/docs/basic-drawing/**/*.md files"
Task: "Fix broken cross-references in docs/docs/advanced-drawing/**/*.md files"

# These can be done by different team members or in parallel batches
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Review baseline analysis, understand warning landscape
5. Decide on remediation priorities

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Baseline established
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Baseline analysis complete ‚Üí Understand problem scope
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Fix broken links ‚Üí Test navigation ‚Üí Major user impact
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Fix syntax issues ‚Üí Test rendering ‚Üí Improved quality
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Update configuration ‚Üí Test build ‚Üí Future-proof
6. Each story adds value and reduces warnings incrementally

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (broken links) - highest user impact
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (syntax errors) - independent category
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (configuration) - independent category
3. Stories complete independently, all contribute to 70% reduction goal

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent operations, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story targets a different warning category and can be independently completed
- Fix warnings in small batches (5-10 at a time) and test after each batch
- Commit after each batch of fixes with clear descriptions
- Never remove content to silence warnings - always fix the underlying issue
- Track progress regularly using progress reports
- Document edge cases where warnings cannot be fixed
- Success criteria: 70%+ reduction (500+ ‚Üí <150 warnings) with zero content loss

---

## Success Metrics

Track these throughout implementation:

- **Total Warning Count**: Baseline 500+ ‚Üí Target <150 (70%+ reduction)
- **Broken Links**: Should reach 0 (100% fixed)
- **Syntax Errors**: 30%+ reduction minimum
- **Configuration Warnings**: Should reach 0 (100% fixed)
- **Content Preservation**: Word count, heading count, code block count must not decrease
- **Build Success**: MkDocs build should always complete successfully
- **Documentation Quality**: Navigation works, rendering is correct, no broken functionality
