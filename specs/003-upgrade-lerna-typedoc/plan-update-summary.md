# Plan Update Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Updated By**: Agent (per user request)  
**Reason**: Align plan with updated specification that includes build process repair

## Changes Made

### plan.md Updates

**1. Summary Section**
- **Added**: "Additionally, fix pre-existing build process failures (TypeDoc documentation generation, TypeScript compilation errors in demos/fonts packages)"
- **Clarified**: Goal is to ensure ALL functionality works successfully, not just "maintain"

**2. Technical Context**
- **Performance Goals**: Changed from "within 10% of baseline" to "must complete successfully (currently fails)"
- **Constraints**: Added "must fix pre-existing build failures"
- **Scale/Scope**: Corrected from 4 to 5 packages (added demos)
- **Added**: New field "Pre-existing Issues" documenting TypeDoc and @types/node problems

**3. Structure Decision**
- **Updated**: From "4 packages" to "5 packages"
- **Updated**: From "Lerna bootstrap" to "npm workspaces"
- **Added**: "requires fixing pre-existing build configuration issues"

### research.md Updates

**Added New Section**: "Build Process Repair Requirements"

This comprehensive section includes:

1. **Decision & Rationale**
   - Why build repair is part of upgrade scope
   - Impact on validation capability

2. **Pre-existing Issues Identified**
   - TypeDoc documentation generation failure (entry points not in tsconfig)
   - TypeScript compilation errors (Buffer interface incompatibility)
   - Build validation impossibility

3. **Action Plan**
   - Fix TypeDoc configuration
   - Fix TypeScript compilation
   - Validate all builds complete with exit code 0

4. **Alternatives Considered**
   - Skip build repair (rejected)
   - Separate task (rejected)
   - Accept broken builds (rejected)

5. **Updated Risk Assessment**
   - Added TypeDoc configuration fix to low risk
   - Added @types/node update to medium risk
   - Added build repair to high risk (mitigated)
   - Enhanced mitigation strategies

## Alignment with Specification

The plan now fully aligns with the updated specification:

| Spec Requirement | Plan Coverage |
|------------------|---------------|
| FR-003: Fix TypeDoc configuration | ✅ Documented in research.md action plan |
| FR-003a: Fix TypeScript errors | ✅ Documented in research.md action plan |
| FR-003b: All packages build successfully | ✅ Included in constraints and validation |
| FR-013: Fix @types/node issues | ✅ Documented in pre-existing issues |
| FR-014: Update TypeDoc tsconfig | ✅ Documented in action plan |
| SC-003: Exit code 0 for all scripts | ✅ Included in validation requirements |
| SC-004: Docs complete successfully | ✅ Updated performance goals |
| SC-007: Valid documentation output | ✅ Included in action plan |

## Impact on Implementation

### Before Update

Implementation would:
- Upgrade dependencies ✅
- Validate builds (fail, but "same as baseline") ⚠️
- Mark tasks complete despite failures ❌
- Leave project in broken state ❌

### After Update

Implementation must:
- Upgrade dependencies ✅
- Fix TypeDoc configuration ✅
- Fix TypeScript compilation errors ✅
- Validate all builds succeed (exit code 0) ✅
- Leave project in fully functional state ✅

## Next Steps for Implementation

The tasks.md file should be regenerated or updated to include:

1. **New Phase 3.5**: Build Process Repair (between current Phase 3 and Phase 4)
   - T033a: Investigate TypeDoc entry point configuration
   - T033b: Update tsconfig to include all entry points
   - T033c: Test documentation generation succeeds
   - T033d: Investigate @types/node Buffer interface error
   - T033e: Update @types/node or TypeScript configuration
   - T033f: Test demos and fonts packages compile
   - T033g: Validate all builds complete with exit code 0

2. **Updated Success Criteria**: All validation tasks must check for exit code 0, not "same as baseline"

3. **Updated Checkpoints**: Each phase must verify builds work before proceeding

## Files Updated

- ✅ `/specs/003-upgrade-lerna-typedoc/plan.md` - Technical context, summary, structure decision
- ✅ `/specs/003-upgrade-lerna-typedoc/research.md` - Added build repair requirements section
- ✅ `/specs/003-upgrade-lerna-typedoc/spec.md` - Already updated (previous conversation)
- ⏳ `/specs/003-upgrade-lerna-typedoc/tasks.md` - Needs regeneration or manual update

## Validation

The updated plan:

- ✅ Aligns with updated specification requirements
- ✅ Documents pre-existing issues clearly
- ✅ Provides actionable fix strategies
- ✅ Maintains risk assessment accuracy
- ✅ Ensures implementation will leave project functional
- ✅ Follows specification-driven development principles
