# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `008-as-a-user` | **Date**: 2025-10-15 | **Spec**: `/specs/008-as-a-user/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/008-as-a-user/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Publish Photon documentation to GitHub Pages from the `main` branch using modern MkDocs (shadcn theme) and ensure automated verification validates the live site shows the latest content and theme. CI will build on `main` and publish the static site to the `gh-pages` branch, which GitHub Pages will serve. Automated Playwright checks will assert presence of core UI markers and recency metadata.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Node.js (Active LTS: 18.x/20.x/22.x) with TypeScript where applicable  
**Primary Dependencies**: MkDocs with `shadcn` theme; plugins: `awesome-pages`, `git-revision-date-localized`, `minify`, `search`; `pymdownx` extensions  
**Storage**: N/A (static site)  
**Testing**: Playwright for end-to-end verification of published docs; existing `playwright.config.js` and `tests/docs-migration/*`  
**Target Platform**: GitHub Pages (source: `gh-pages` branch)  
**Project Type**: Monorepo with documentation site under `docs/`  
**Performance Goals**: Build/publish pipeline completes reliably; site interactive load matches mkdocs defaults  
**Constraints**: From spec success criteria: live update ≤ 10 minutes p95; 0 outdated theme occurrences over 30 days; automated verification 95% pass rate; `site_url` confirmed  
**Scale/Scope**: Documentation site; no backend services

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with Maker.js Constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`):

- [x] **Test-Driven Development**: Tests will be written before implementation (Playwright checks for docs)
- [x] **Specification-Driven**: User stories defined with acceptance criteria (see `spec.md`)
- [x] **ES6+ Compatibility**: Modern JavaScript features supported
- [x] **Experiment-Friendly**: Playground/UX considerations addressed
- [x] **User Experience First**: Documentation and error messages are clear
- [x] **Living Documentation**: Documentation updates included in plan
- [x] **CNC/Laser Focus**: Precision and export format requirements considered
- [x] **Code Quality**: Linting, TypeScript, and code review process defined
- [x] **Performance Standards**: Performance goals documented if applicable
- [x] **Versioning**: Semantic versioning impact assessed (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH)

**Structure Decision**: Use existing monorepo structure with documentation under `docs/`, CI under `.github/workflows/`, and verification under `tests/docs-migration/` using Playwright.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
