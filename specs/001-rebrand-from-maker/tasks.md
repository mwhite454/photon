# Tasks: Rebrand to Photon

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-rebrand-from-maker/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: This rebrand uses verification scripts instead of traditional unit tests. Verification tasks are included at checkpoints.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Monorepo structure**: `packages/photon/`, `packages/playground/`, `packages/fonts/`, `packages/docs/`
- **Documentation**: `docs/`, `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `NOTICE`, `LICENSE`
- **Constitution**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion (T001-T012) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (T013-T020) - MVP delivery
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 (T021-T039) - Documentation needs core identity
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 1 (T021-T039) - Roadmap needs core identity
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after US1 complete - Needs package names and namespaces finalized
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after US1 complete - Independent of US2, can run in parallel

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**: Namespaces ‚Üí Build config ‚Üí README (sequential within groups, parallel across groups)
- **US2**: API docs ‚Üí Tutorials ‚Üí Examples ‚Üí Playground (mostly sequential, some parallel within groups)
- **US3**: Roadmap review ‚Üí Metadata updates (sequential)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase (T001-T012)**:
- T001, T002, T003, T004, T005 can all run in parallel
- T007-T011 can all run in parallel (creating different scripts)

**Foundational Phase (T013-T020)**:
- Must be sequential (directory rename blocks package.json updates)

**User Story 1 (T021-T039)**:
- T021-T025 can run in parallel (different source files)
- T027-T030 can run in parallel (different config files)

**User Story 2 (T040-T068)**:
- T043-T046 can run in parallel (different doc files)
- T048-T050 can run in parallel (different example files)
- T062-T064 can run in parallel (different HTML files)

**User Story 3 (T069-T079)**:
- T076-T078 can run in parallel (different metadata fields)

**Polish (T080-T093)**:
- T080-T082 can run in parallel (different file types)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch namespace renames together:
Task T021: "Find/replace in packages/photon/src: namespace MakerJs ‚Üí namespace Photon"
Task T022: "Find/replace in packages/photon/src: MakerJs. ‚Üí Photon."
Task T023: "Find/replace in packages/photon/src: typeof MakerJs ‚Üí typeof Photon"
Task T024: "Find/replace in packages/playground/src: namespace MakerJsPlayground ‚Üí namespace PhotonPlayground"
Task T025: "Find/replace in packages/playground/src: MakerJsPlayground. ‚Üí PhotonPlayground."

# Then verify:
Task T026: "Run verify-namespaces.sh"

# Launch build config updates together:
Task T027: "Update packages/photon/tsconfig.json"
Task T028: "Update packages/photon/vite.config.ts output names"
Task T029: "Update packages/photon/vite.config.ts global variable"
Task T030: "Update packages/photon/target/build.js"

# Then build and verify:
Task T031: "npm run build"
Task T032: "Run verify-dist-files.sh"
Task T033: "Run verify-build.sh"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T012)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T013-T020) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T021-T039)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run all verification scripts
5. Test build and basic functionality
6. **MVP DELIVERED**: Core identity rebrand complete

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **MVP!**
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Documentation complete
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Roadmap complete
5. Polish ‚Üí Final verification ‚Üí **RELEASE READY**

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T021-T039)
   - Wait for US1 checkpoint, then:
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T040-T068)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T069-T079)
3. Team completes Polish together (T080-T093)

---

## Time Estimates

Based on quickstart.md estimates:

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 30 minutes (T001-T012)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 45 minutes (T013-T020)
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: 90 minutes (T021-T039)
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: 135 minutes (T040-T068)
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: 30 minutes (T069-T079)
- **Phase 6 (Polish)**: 30 minutes (T080-T093)

**Total**: ~6 hours (360 minutes)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within group
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Verification scripts provide automated quality gates
- Manual testing required for playground and documentation quality
- Commit after completing each user story phase
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Follow quickstart.md for detailed step-by-step instructions

---
