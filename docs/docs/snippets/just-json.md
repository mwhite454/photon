Remember that your models are plain old JavaScript objects. This is also true for the basic models included with Maker.js we've seen above.
To illustrate this, we will export a model using JSON.stringify. Let's use the Tablet Mount again as our example:


## Examples

```javascript
import { exporter, models, paths } from '@7syllable/photon-core';
const outer = new models.RoundRectangle(200, 280, 8);
const inner = new models.RoundRectangle(160, 230, 8);
inner.origin = [20, 30];
const buttonhole = new paths.Circle([100, 15], 8);
const bolts = new models.BoltRectangle(180, 260, 2);
bolts.origin = [10, 10];
const tabletFaceMount = {
paths: { buttonhole: buttonhole },
models: { inner: inner, outer: outer, bolts: bolts }
};
const svg = exporter.toSVG(tabletFaceMount);
document.write(svg);
```

Now let's pass tabletFaceMount through JSON.stringify and look at the result:

```javascript
import { exporter, models, paths } from '@7syllable/photon-core';
const outer = new models.RoundRectangle(200, 280, 8);
const inner = new models.RoundRectangle(160, 230, 8);
inner.origin = [20, 30];
const buttonhole = new paths.Circle([100, 15], 8);
const bolts = new models.BoltRectangle(180, 260, 2);
bolts.origin = [10, 10];
const tabletFaceMount = {
paths: { buttonhole: buttonhole },
models: { inner: inner, outer: outer, bolts: bolts }
};
const json = JSON.stringify(tabletFaceMount);
document.write(``${json}`

---

`);
```

We can copy and paste this same JSON and re-use it directly as a model:

```javascript
//render from a blob of JSON
import { exporter, models, paths } from '@7syllable/photon-core';
const tabletFaceMount = {"paths":{"buttonhole":{"origin":[100,15],"radius":8,"type":"circle"}},"models":{"inner":{"paths":{"BottomLeft":{"origin":[8,8],"radius":8,"startAngle":180,"endAngle":270,"type":"arc"},"BottomRight":{"origin":[152,8],"radius":8,"startAngle":270,"endAngle":0,"type":"arc"},"TopRight":{"origin":[152,222],"radius":8,"startAngle":0,"endAngle":90,"type":"arc"},"TopLeft":{"origin":[8,222],"radius":8,"startAngle":90,"endAngle":180,"type":"arc"},"Bottom":{"origin":[8,0],"end":[152,0],"type":"line"},"Top":{"origin":[152,230],"end":[8,230],"type":"line"},"Right":{"origin":[160,8],"end":[160,222],"type":"line"},"Left":{"origin":[0,222],"end":[0,8],"type":"line"}},"origin":[20,30]},"outer":{"paths":{"BottomLeft":{"origin":[8,8],"radius":8,"startAngle":180,"endAngle":270,"type":"arc"},"BottomRight":{"origin":[192,8],"radius":8,"startAngle":270,"endAngle":0,"type":"arc"},"TopRight":{"origin":[192,272],"radius":8,"startAngle":0,"endAngle":90,"type":"arc"},"TopLeft":{"origin":[8,272],"radius":8,"startAngle":90,"endAngle":180,"type":"arc"},"Bottom":{"origin":[8,0],"end":[192,0],"type":"line"},"Top":{"origin":[192,280],"end":[8,280],"type":"line"},"Right":{"origin":[200,8],"end":[200,272],"type":"line"},"Left":{"origin":[0,272],"end":[0,8],"type":"line"}}},"bolts":{"paths":{"BottomLeft\_bolt":{"origin":[0,0],"radius":2,"type":"circle"},"BottomRight\_bolt":{"origin":[180,0],"radius":2,"type":"circle"},"TopRight\_bolt":{"origin":[180,260],"radius":2,"type":"circle"},"TopLeft\_bolt":{"origin":[0,260],"radius":2,"type":"circle"}},"origin":[10,10]}}};
const svg = exporter.toSVG(tabletFaceMount);
document.write(svg);
```

Note that you might obtain JSON from some other source, perhaps generated by a tool. The only requirement for it to work with Maker.js is it must have the properties as described above.
