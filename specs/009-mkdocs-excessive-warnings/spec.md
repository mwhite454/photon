# Feature Specification: MkDocs Warning Remediation

**Feature Branch**: `009-mkdocs-excessive-warnings`  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "mkdocs excessive warnings is getting overwhelming. Please draft a user story specification to investigate source and remediate >70% of current 500+ warnings that display on build. We do not want to break content, or remove content just to stop the warnings. We want to ensure that our users have the highest quality documentation possible"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Warning Baseline and Categorization (Priority: P1)

As a documentation maintainer, I need to understand the current state of MkDocs warnings so that I can prioritize remediation efforts based on warning types, frequency, and impact on documentation quality.

**Why this priority**: Without understanding what warnings exist and their root causes, we cannot effectively remediate them. This is the foundation for all subsequent work and provides measurable baseline metrics.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the MkDocs build process, capturing all warnings to a structured report, and categorizing them by type (e.g., broken links, missing references, syntax errors, plugin warnings). Delivers a complete inventory and baseline count.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the documentation build process, **When** MkDocs build is executed, **Then** all warnings are captured with their source file, line number, and warning type
2. **Given** captured warnings, **When** categorization is performed, **Then** warnings are grouped by type with counts and percentage of total
3. **Given** categorized warnings, **When** analysis is complete, **Then** a baseline report shows current warning count (500+) and distribution across categories

### User Story 2 - High-Impact Warning Remediation (Priority: P2)

As a documentation user, I need the documentation to be free of broken links and missing references so that I can navigate the documentation effectively and find all referenced information.

**Why this priority**: Broken links and missing references directly impact user experience and documentation usability. These are typically the most visible and frustrating issues for users trying to learn from the documentation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by identifying and fixing all broken internal links, missing cross-references, and invalid anchor links. Delivers immediate user value by ensuring all navigation paths work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** documentation with broken internal links, **When** links are validated and corrected, **Then** all internal navigation functions without 404 errors
2. **Given** documentation with missing cross-references, **When** references are validated, **Then** all referenced sections, pages, and code snippets exist and are correctly linked
3. **Given** fixed links and references, **When** MkDocs build runs, **Then** warnings related to broken links and missing references are reduced by at least 50%

### User Story 3 - Markdown Syntax and Formatting Warnings (Priority: P3)

As a documentation maintainer, I need all markdown files to follow consistent syntax and formatting standards so that the documentation renders correctly and warnings related to syntax errors are eliminated.

**Why this priority**: Syntax warnings indicate potential rendering issues but typically don't break functionality. Fixing these improves code quality and ensures consistent presentation across all documentation pages.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by validating markdown syntax, fixing malformed tables, correcting heading hierarchies, and ensuring proper code block formatting. Delivers cleaner, more maintainable documentation source files.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** markdown files with syntax warnings, **When** syntax is validated and corrected, **Then** all markdown renders correctly without formatting errors
2. **Given** malformed tables or lists, **When** formatting is corrected, **Then** tables and lists display properly in the rendered documentation
3. **Given** corrected syntax, **When** MkDocs build runs, **Then** syntax-related warnings are reduced by at least 30%

---

### User Story 4 - Plugin and Configuration Warnings (Priority: P4)

As a documentation maintainer, I need the MkDocs configuration and plugins to be properly configured so that the build process runs cleanly without deprecation or configuration warnings.

**Why this priority**: Configuration warnings don't directly impact users but indicate technical debt and potential future breaking changes. Addressing these ensures long-term maintainability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by reviewing MkDocs configuration, updating deprecated plugin settings, and ensuring all plugin dependencies are correctly specified. Delivers a more stable and future-proof build configuration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** MkDocs configuration with deprecated settings, **When** configuration is updated to current standards, **Then** deprecation warnings are eliminated
2. **Given** plugin configuration warnings, **When** plugin settings are validated and corrected, **Then** all plugins load without warnings
3. **Given** updated configuration, **When** MkDocs build runs, **Then** configuration-related warnings are reduced to zero

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a warning cannot be fixed without removing content? Document the warning as accepted with justification.
- How does the system handle warnings from third-party plugins that cannot be controlled? Document as external dependencies and monitor for plugin updates.
- What happens when fixing one warning introduces new warnings? Implement iterative validation with regression testing after each fix.
- How do we handle warnings in auto-generated documentation? Investigate source generation process and fix at the generation level rather than in output files.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST capture and log all MkDocs build warnings with source file path, line number, warning type, and warning message
- **FR-002**: System MUST categorize warnings into distinct types (broken links, missing references, syntax errors, plugin warnings, configuration warnings)
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a baseline report showing total warning count and distribution by category before remediation begins
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate all internal links and cross-references to identify broken or missing targets
- **FR-005**: System MUST fix broken links by updating paths or creating missing target content without removing existing documentation
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate markdown syntax and correct formatting errors while preserving content meaning and structure
- **FR-007**: System MUST update MkDocs configuration to eliminate deprecation warnings and ensure compatibility with current plugin versions
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a post-remediation report showing warning reduction by category and overall percentage improvement
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain a log of all changes made during remediation for review and potential rollback
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure no content is removed or functionality broken as a result of warning remediation

### Key Entities

- **Warning Report**: Contains warning type, source file, line number, message, category, and remediation status
- **Documentation File**: Markdown file with metadata including path, warning count, and remediation history
- **Link Reference**: Internal or external link with source location, target location, and validation status
- **Build Configuration**: MkDocs configuration settings, plugin configurations, and build parameters

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Total MkDocs build warnings reduced from 500+ to fewer than 150 (70%+ reduction)
- **SC-002**: All broken internal links and missing cross-references are identified and fixed (100% of link-related warnings resolved)
- **SC-003**: Markdown syntax warnings reduced by at least 30% while maintaining all existing content
- **SC-004**: Configuration and plugin warnings reduced to zero
- **SC-005**: Documentation build completes successfully with no errors and reduced warning noise
- **SC-006**: Zero content removed or functionality broken as measured by before/after content audits and link validation tests
- **SC-007**: Remediation changes are documented with clear rationale for each category of fixes
- **SC-008**: Post-remediation documentation quality metrics show improvement in navigation success rate and reduced user-reported issues
