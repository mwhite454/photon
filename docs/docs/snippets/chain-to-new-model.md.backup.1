title: Chain to new model
---
Once you have a chain, you can also convert it to a model, so that you can return to using the familiar [model API](/docs/api/modules/makerjs.model.md)
with your shapes. Call [makerjs.chain.toNewModel(chain, detachFromOldModel: boolean)](/docs/api/modules/makerjs.chain.md#tonewmodel).
