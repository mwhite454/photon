## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Phase 2 (US1 - Security)**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Phase 3 (US2 - Compatibility)**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Build Repair)**: Depends on Phase 3 - MUST complete before US3
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Config)**: Depends on Phase 4 completion
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Features)**: Depends on Phase 4 completion - Can run in parallel with US3
- **Phase 7 (Validation)**: Depends on Phase 4-6 completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Security)**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - All other stories depend on this
- **User Story 2 (P1 - Build)**: PARTIALLY COMPLETE - Build repair (Phase 4) is BLOCKING for US3/US4
- **User Story 3 (P2 - Config)**: Can start after US2 build repair, independent of US4
- **User Story 4 (P3 - Features)**: Can start after US2 build repair, can run parallel with US3

### Within Phase 4 (Build Repair)

- **Investigation (T034-T035)**: Can run in parallel [P]
- **TypeDoc Fix (T036-T038)**: Sequential, depends on T034
- **TypeScript Fix (T039-T041)**: Sequential, depends on T035
- **Full Validation (T042-T046)**: Sequential, depends on all fixes

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 4**: T034, T035 (investigations) can run in parallel
- **Phase 5**: T047, T048 (changelog reviews) can run in parallel
- **Phase 6**: T057, T058 (feature reviews) can run in parallel
- **Phase 7**: T068, T069 (documentation updates) can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### Sequential Validation Approach (Recommended)

This is a dependency upgrade WITH build repair, so sequential validation is critical:

1. **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ Setup - Baseline metrics captured
2. **Phase 2**: ‚úÖ US1 (Security) - Dependencies upgraded, zero vulnerabilities
3. **Phase 3**: ‚úÖ US2 (Compatibility) - Upgrade validated, pre-existing issues confirmed
4. **Phase 4**: US2 (Build Repair) - Fix pre-existing build failures
   - **STOP and VALIDATE**: All builds succeed with exit code 0
   - **Rollback point**: If fixes break something, revert build changes
5. **Phase 5**: US3 (Config) - Migrate configuration
   - **STOP and VALIDATE**: No deprecation warnings
   - **Rollback point**: If warnings persist, investigate before proceeding
6. **Phase 6**: US4 (Features) - Document new capabilities
   - **STOP and VALIDATE**: Features documented
   - **No rollback needed**: Documentation only
7. **Phase 7**: Final validation and merge

### Rollback Procedure

At any checkpoint, if validation fails:

```bash
# Full rollback
git checkout package.json package-lock.json lerna.json
# If build fixes were applied, also revert:
git checkout packages/photon/target/tsconfig.typedoc.json
git checkout packages/photon/typedoc.json
git checkout docs/demos/package.json docs/demos/tsconfig.json
git checkout packages/fonts/package.json packages/fonts/tsconfig.json
npm install

# Verify rollback
npm test
```

## Success Criteria Reference

From spec.md (updated), this upgrade is successful when:

- **SC-001**: ‚úÖ Lerna upgraded to v8.2.4 (T015) - COMPLETED
- **SC-002**: ‚úÖ TypeDoc upgraded to v0.28.14 (T016) - COMPLETED
- **SC-003**: ‚è≥ All npm scripts exit with code 0 including previously broken builds (T042-T045)
- **SC-004**: ‚è≥ Documentation build completes successfully fixing pre-existing failure (T044)
- **SC-005**: ‚úÖ Zero high/critical vulnerabilities (T017-T018) - COMPLETED
- **SC-006**: ‚è≥ All tests pass without modification (T045)
- **SC-007**: ‚è≥ Generated docs complete and valid fixing pre-existing failure (T044, T054-T056)
- **SC-008**: ‚è≥ Clean install works (T063-T067)

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 73 (T001-T073)
- **Completed**: 33 tasks (T001-T033)
- **Remaining**: 40 tasks (T034-T073)

**By Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 6 tasks ‚úÖ
- Phase 2 (US1 Security): 12 tasks ‚úÖ
- Phase 3 (US2 Compatibility): 15 tasks ‚úÖ
- Phase 4 (US2 Build Repair): 13 tasks ‚è≥ **CURRENT FOCUS**
- Phase 5 (US3 Config): 10 tasks
- Phase 6 (US4 Features): 6 tasks
- Phase 7 (Final Validation): 11 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 8 task groups can run in parallel

**Critical Path**: Phase 4 (Build Repair) is blocking for all remaining work

---

## Notes

- This is a dependency upgrade WITH build process repair - tasks are sequential with validation checkpoints
- Each user story represents a validation concern and must be independently testable
- Rollback capability is critical - commit after each phase
- Performance benchmarks must be compared to baseline at each checkpoint
- **Build repair (Phase 4) is MANDATORY** - cannot proceed without functional builds
- All tasks must complete successfully before merge
