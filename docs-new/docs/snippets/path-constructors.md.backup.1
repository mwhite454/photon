title: Path constructors
---

In the example code above we used plain old JavaScript objects to create paths and models.
Notice that we didn't need to use a special constructor provided by Maker.js to create either a path or a model.
This is an intentional aspect of Maker.js, that you can decide how to create your objects.
To make these plain objects work with Maker.js, they needed to use the property names specified above.

We also illustrated 3 ways of defining an object: using a var, using a function that returns a var,
and using a constructor function (for use by the **new** keyword). Let's revisit our simple line path example,
and convert it to a constructor function.

```javascript
//render a line
var makerjs = require('makerjs');
var line = {
type: 'line',
origin: [0, 0],
end: [50, 50]
};
var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG(line);
document.write(svg);
```
```javascript
//render a line created by a function
var makerjs = require('makerjs');
function line() {
this.type = 'line',
this.origin = [0, 0],
this.end = [50, 50]
};
var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG(new line());
document.write(svg);
```

Of course this example is not very useful because it only produces a line with the same origin and end every time.
Instead, these should be passed as parameters.

Since this is a common scenario, Maker.js provides constructors for all primitive paths: line, circle and arc:

* [makerjs.paths.Line](/docs/api/classes/makerjs.paths.line.md#constructor)
* [makerjs.paths.Circle](/docs/api/classes/makerjs.paths.circle.md#constructor)
* [makerjs.paths.Arc](/docs/api/classes/makerjs.paths.arc.md#constructor)

```javascript
//render the basic paths
var makerjs = require('makerjs');
var line = new makerjs.paths.Line([0, 0], [50, 50]);
var circle = new makerjs.paths.Circle([0, 0], 50);
var arc = new makerjs.paths.Arc([0, 0], 25, 0, 90);
var svg = makerjs.exporter.toSVG([line, circle, arc]);
document.write(svg);
```
