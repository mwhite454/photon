# Tasks: Upgrade Lerna & TypeDoc to Latest Versions

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-upgrade-lerna-typedoc/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/upgrade-procedure.md, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are organized by user story priority (P1 â†’ P2 â†’ P3) to enable incremental validation and safe rollback at each checkpoint.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1-US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Baseline & Preparation)

**Purpose**: Establish baseline metrics and prepare for upgrade

- [X] T001 Create feature branch `003-upgrade-lerna-typedoc` from main
- [X] T002 Capture baseline docs build time: `time npm run docs > baseline-docs-build.log 2>&1`
- [X] T003 [P] Capture baseline test execution time: `time npm test > baseline-test.log 2>&1`
- [X] T004 [P] Run security audit: `npm audit --json > baseline-audit.json`
- [X] T005 [P] Capture current versions: `npm list lerna typedoc --depth=0 > baseline-versions.txt`
- [X] T006 Verify Node.js version is 18+ (required by Lerna v8.x): `node --version`

**Checkpoint**: Baseline metrics captured, ready to proceed with upgrade

- [X] T015 [US1] Verify Lerna v8.2.4 installed: `npm list lerna --depth=0`
- [X] T016 [US1] Verify TypeDoc v0.28.14 installed: `npm list typedoc --depth=0`
- [X] T017 [US1] Run security audit: `npm audit --audit-level=high`
- [X] T018 [US1] Verify zero high/critical vulnerabilities for Lerna and TypeDoc

**Checkpoint**: Dependencies upgraded, security audit passed (SC-001, SC-002, SC-005)

## Phase 3: User Story 2 - Build Process Compatibility (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯

**Goal**: Ensure all existing build scripts and documentation generation work after dependency upgrades

**Independent Test**: Run all npm scripts and verify they complete successfully without errors

### Implementation for User Story 2

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Phase 2 (US1 - Security)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion - MUST complete before US2
- **Phase 3 (US2 - Build)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - MUST complete before US3
- **Phase 4 (US3 - Config)**: Depends on Phase 3 completion - Can run before US4
- **Phase 5 (US4 - Features)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - Can run in parallel with US3
- **Phase 6 (Validation)**: Depends on Phase 2-5 completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Security)**: BLOCKING - Must complete first, all other stories depend on this
- **User Story 2 (P1 - Build)**: BLOCKING - Must complete second, validates upgrade works
- **User Story 3 (P2 - Config)**: Can start after US2, independent of US4
- **User Story 4 (P3 - Features)**: Can start after US1, can run parallel with US2/US3

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**: Sequential dependency updates â†’ install â†’ verification
- **US2**: Sequential build validation (bootstrap â†’ build-tools â†’ build â†’ docs â†’ test)
- **US3**: Parallel changelog reviews â†’ sequential validation
- **US4**: Parallel feature reviews â†’ documentation

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: T003, T004, T005 (baseline captures) can run in parallel
- **Phase 5**: T044, T045 (changelog reviews) can run in parallel
- **Phase 6**: T055, T056 (documentation updates) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Baseline Capture

```bash
# Launch all baseline captures together:
Task: "Capture baseline test execution time"
Task: "Run security audit"
Task: "Capture current versions"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Sequential Validation Approach (Recommended)

This is a dependency upgrade with breaking changes, so sequential validation is critical:

1. **Phase 1**: Setup - Capture baseline metrics
2. **Phase 2**: US1 (Security) - Upgrade dependencies, verify security
   - **STOP and VALIDATE**: Dependencies installed, no vulnerabilities
   - **Rollback point**: If security audit fails, revert package.json
3. **Phase 3**: US2 (Build) - Validate all build processes work
   - **STOP and VALIDATE**: All builds pass, tests pass, performance acceptable
   - **Rollback point**: If builds fail, full rollback
4. **Phase 4**: US3 (Config) - Migrate configuration
   - **STOP and VALIDATE**: No deprecation warnings
   - **Rollback point**: If warnings persist, investigate before proceeding
5. **Phase 5**: US4 (Features) - Document new capabilities
   - **STOP and VALIDATE**: Features documented
   - **No rollback needed**: Documentation only
6. **Phase 6**: Final validation and merge

### Rollback Procedure

At any checkpoint, if validation fails:

```bash
# Full rollback
git checkout package.json package-lock.json lerna.json
npm install

# Verify rollback
npm test
```

## Edge Cases & Risk Mitigation

### Edge Case: Lerna bootstrap breaking changes

**Risk**: `lerna bootstrap` deprecated in v7, removed in v9
**Mitigation**: T009-T012 update scripts to use npm workspaces
**Validation**: T022-T023 verify workspace linking works

### Edge Case: TypeDoc output structure changes

**Risk**: TypeDoc v0.28 may render documentation differently
**Mitigation**: T041-T043 compare output to baseline
**Validation**: Visual review and link checking

### Edge Case: Node.js version compatibility

**Risk**: Lerna v8 requires Node.js 18+
**Mitigation**: T006 verify Node.js version before starting
**Validation**: Pre-flight check in Phase 1

### Edge Case: Peer dependency conflicts

**Risk**: TypeDoc or Lerna may have conflicting peer dependencies
**Mitigation**: T014 install will surface conflicts
**Validation**: T017-T018 security audit and manual review

## Notes

- This is a dependency upgrade, not a feature implementation - tasks are sequential with validation checkpoints
- Each user story represents a validation concern, not an independent feature
- Rollback capability is critical - commit after each phase
- Performance benchmarks must be compared to baseline at each checkpoint
- All tasks must complete successfully before merge
- No [P] markers within user stories except for independent reviews/documentation
