# Feature Specification: Local Development Site Preview & Defect Inventory

**Feature Branch**: `005-as-a-photon`  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "as a Photon developer I need to be able to preview the existing Photon site infrastructure when developing locally. Currently when starting the server there are a number of issues, including missing styles and compilation for the docs. Agents are empowered to use mcp-playwright tools to view localhost and navigate through the site and collect issues with documentation and styling to create a comprehensive inventory of outstanding defects"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Start Local Development Server Successfully (Priority: P1)

As a Photon developer, I need to start the local development server and have it run without critical errors so that I can preview the documentation site while developing.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for all local development work. Without a functioning server, no other development or testing activities can proceed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting the development server and verifying it runs without errors and serves content on localhost. Delivers immediate value by enabling local development.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Photon repository is cloned locally, **When** I run the command to start the development server, **Then** the server starts without compilation errors
2. **Given** the development server is running, **When** I navigate to the localhost URL in a browser, **Then** the site loads and displays content
3. **Given** the development server is running, **When** I check the console output, **Then** there are no critical error messages preventing site functionality

### User Story 2 - View Documentation with Correct Styling (Priority: P2)

As a Photon developer, I need to view the documentation site with all styles properly applied so that I can verify the visual presentation matches the intended design.

**Why this priority**: Proper styling is essential for validating documentation changes and ensuring a professional appearance. This directly impacts the developer experience when reviewing changes.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading any documentation page and verifying that CSS styles are applied correctly. Delivers value by enabling visual validation of documentation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the development server is running, **When** I navigate to any documentation page, **Then** all CSS styles are loaded and applied correctly
2. **Given** I am viewing a documentation page, **When** I inspect the page elements, **Then** no style-related errors appear in the browser console
3. **Given** the documentation includes code examples, **When** I view these examples, **Then** syntax highlighting and formatting are properly displayed

### User Story 3 - Automated Defect Discovery and Inventory (Priority: P3)

As a Photon developer or AI agent, I need an automated way to navigate the local site and collect all documentation and styling issues so that I can create a comprehensive defect inventory without manual testing.

**Why this priority**: Automation accelerates the defect discovery process and ensures comprehensive coverage. While valuable, this can be done manually if needed, making it lower priority than having a working server and correct styling.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running an automated browser navigation script that visits all documentation pages and generates a defect report. Delivers value by providing a complete inventory of issues.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the development server is running, **When** an automated browser tool navigates through all site pages, **Then** it successfully visits each page without navigation failures
2. **Given** the automated tool is navigating the site, **When** it encounters styling issues or missing content, **Then** it records each issue with page URL and description
3. **Given** the automated navigation is complete, **When** the tool generates a report, **Then** the report includes all discovered defects categorized by type (styling, content, functionality)
4. **Given** the defect inventory is generated, **When** a developer reviews it, **Then** each defect entry includes sufficient detail to reproduce and fix the issue

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the development server encounters port conflicts?
- How does the system handle missing or corrupted asset files?
- What happens when documentation pages reference non-existent resources?
- How does the automated defect discovery handle dynamic content or JavaScript-rendered pages?
- What happens when the browser automation tool encounters authentication or access restrictions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The development server MUST start without compilation errors that prevent the site from loading
- **FR-002**: The development server MUST serve all documentation pages on localhost
- **FR-003**: All CSS stylesheets MUST load correctly and be applied to documentation pages
- **FR-004**: Documentation pages MUST render with proper formatting including code syntax highlighting
- **FR-005**: The system MUST support automated browser navigation tools accessing the local site
- **FR-006**: Automated tools MUST be able to traverse all documentation pages through navigation links
- **FR-007**: The defect inventory MUST capture the page URL, defect type, and description for each issue found
- **FR-008**: Defect types MUST include at minimum: missing styles, broken links, compilation errors, and missing content
- **FR-009**: The defect inventory MUST be stored in a structured format that can be reviewed and tracked
- **FR-010**: Console errors and warnings MUST be captured as part of the defect inventory

### Key Entities

- **Defect Record**: Represents a single issue discovered during site inspection. Includes page URL, defect type (styling, content, functionality, compilation), severity level, description, and timestamp of discovery.
- **Page Inventory**: Represents the collection of all documentation pages discovered during navigation. Includes page URL, title, navigation path, and status (accessible, error, missing).
- **Defect Report**: Aggregated collection of all defect records organized by type and severity. Includes summary statistics, affected pages count, and prioritization recommendations.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Development server starts successfully within 30 seconds without critical compilation errors
- **SC-002**: 100% of documentation pages are accessible and load without HTTP errors when the server is running
- **SC-003**: All CSS stylesheets load successfully with zero 404 errors in browser console
- **SC-004**: Automated browser navigation successfully visits and inspects all documentation pages without failures
- **SC-005**: Defect inventory captures at least 95% of visible styling and content issues present on the site
- **SC-006**: Each defect record includes sufficient detail (URL, type, description) for a developer to locate and reproduce the issue
- **SC-007**: Complete defect inventory generation takes less than 5 minutes for the entire documentation site
- **SC-008**: Developers can identify and prioritize fixes based on the structured defect report within 10 minutes of reviewing it
