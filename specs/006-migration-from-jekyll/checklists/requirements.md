# Specification Quality Checklist: Documentation Migration from Jekyll to MkDocs

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification focuses on WHAT needs to be migrated (Jekyll to MkDocs, snippets to markdown, theme application) and WHY (eliminate Ruby dependency, improve maintainability, modern UI). While MkDocs and mkdocs-shadcn are mentioned, they are the subject of the migration itself, not implementation details of how to achieve it.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 14 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (build time <10 seconds, 100% content preservation, zero broken links). All 4 user stories have acceptance scenarios defined. Edge cases cover liquid tag translation, Jekyll-specific features, link handling, and theme configuration.

3. **Feature Readiness**: The four user stories are prioritized (P1: MkDocs setup, P2: content migration, P3: navigation, P4: automated testing) and independently testable. Each story delivers standalone value. Success criteria align with functional requirements and provide clear measurable outcomes.

## Notes

- Specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and actionable
- The scope is well-bounded: migrating from Jekyll to MkDocs with specific focus on snippet conversion and theme application
- Migration scripts and automation tools will be defined in the planning phase
