# Data Model

**Feature**: Critical Dependency Modernization  
**Status**: N/A

## Not Applicable

This feature involves upgrading external dependencies only. There are no data models, entities, or state management changes required.

## Relevant Artifacts

For this feature, see instead:
- [research.md](./research.md) - Migration patterns for each dependency
- [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md) - Step-by-step upgrade guide
- [research-findings.md](./research-findings.md) - Detailed dependency analysis

## Dependencies Upgraded

1. **graham_scan**: Convex hull calculation library (no data model)
2. **bezier-js**: Bezier curve operations library (no data model)
3. **kdbush**: Spatial indexing library (no data model)

All three are computational libraries with no persistent state or data structures that require modeling.
