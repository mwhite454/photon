# Content Refactoring Quality Checklist: User Story 5

**Purpose**: Validate content refactoring completeness and quality (maker.js → photon/core, ES6+ modernization)
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md) - User Story 5  
**Status**: Pending

## API Migration Completeness

- [X] API mapping document exists and is comprehensive
- [X] All maker.js namespace references replaced with photon/core
- [X] All import statements updated to ES6 module syntax
- [X] No legacy global namespace usage remains (61 files converted from `import * as makerjs` to named imports)
- [X] Breaking API changes documented with migration notes
- [X] Deprecated maker.js features handled appropriately (root methods like cloneObject, travel now imported directly)

## Code Modernization

- [X] All `var` declarations replaced with `const`/`let` (all var declarations converted in snippets)
- [X] All function expressions converted to arrow functions where appropriate (constructor functions correctly use function keyword)
- [X] String concatenation replaced with template literals (completed in Phase 8)
- [X] Object property shorthand used where applicable (used in examples: `{ plus, plus2, outer }`)
- [N/A] Destructuring used for cleaner code where appropriate (named imports provide this: `import { models, paths }`)
- [X] No pre-ES6 patterns remain (all code examples modernized to ES6+)

## Documentation Quality

- [⏳] TypeDoc API reference integrated into MkDocs *(requires TypeDoc generation from photon/core source - see T074)*
- [⏳] All API documentation links point to correct photon/core pages *(requires TypeDoc generation - links updated to best-effort paths)*
- [X] Code examples include proper import statements
- [X] Examples use photon/core API methods correctly
- [X] Backward compatibility notes present where needed
- [X] Migration guide created for maker.js → photon/core transition

## Validation & Testing

- [⏳] All code examples execute without errors *(requires photon/core package - validator script ready)*
- [⏳] Example validator reports 100% pass rate *(requires photon/core package - see T077)*
- [⏳] Visual output matches expected results *(requires photon/core package for rendering)*
- [⏳] Playground verification completed for representative examples *(requires photon/core in playground - see T080)*
- [⏳] No console errors when executing refactored examples *(requires photon/core package)*
- [⏳] Performance not degraded compared to original examples *(requires photon/core package for benchmarking)*

## Content Preservation

- [⏳] All original functionality preserved in refactored examples *(requires execution testing with photon/core)*
- [X] No code examples removed during refactoring *(verified - all examples migrated)*
- [⏳] Visual output equivalent to original maker.js examples *(requires visual regression testing with photon/core)*
- [X] Example intent and educational value maintained *(manual review confirms examples are clear)*
- [~] Comments and explanations updated to reflect new API *(spot-check recommended - see T079)*

## Refactoring Coverage

- [X] Refactoring report shows 100% of maker.js references replaced (294 total changes across 2 phases)
- [X] All documentation sections reviewed and updated (snippets, converted API docs, migration guide)
- [X] Getting started examples modernized (getting-started-browser.md, getting-started-node.md updated)
- [X] Advanced examples modernized (chains, dogbones, fillets, layouts all updated)
- [X] API reference examples modernized (converted/ directory examples updated)
- [X] Tutorial content updated (template.md updated with modern patterns)

## Notes

### Legend
- [X] Complete
- [⏳] Pending external dependency (photon/core package or TypeDoc)
- [~] Partial/needs manual review
- [N/A] Not applicable

### External Dependencies Required
All items marked [⏳] require one or both of:
1. **photon/core package** to be published to npm
2. **TypeDoc API reference** to be generated from photon/core source

These items should be completed after photon/core is published but **before proceeding to Phase 9** (AI-Friendly Documentation Enhancement).

### Completion Status
- **Completed**: 19/35 items (54%)
- **Pending Dependencies**: 13/35 items (37%)
- **Partial/Review Needed**: 1/35 items (3%)
- **Not Applicable**: 2/35 items (6%)
- **Total Addressable Now**: 22/35 items (63% - all non-dependent items complete)

### Modernization Work Completed
- ✅ 61 files converted from namespace imports to named imports
- ✅ 294 total code changes across 2 modernization phases
- ✅ All var declarations converted to const
- ✅ All ES6+ patterns applied where appropriate
- ✅ Getting started guides updated with modern examples
- ✅ API mapping guide comprehensive and complete

### Next Steps
1. **Manual Review** (Optional): Spot-check 10% of examples for comment accuracy
2. **Wait for photon/core**: Package must be published to npm
3. **Execute Validation**: Run example_validator.py when photon/core available
4. **TypeDoc Integration**: Generate and integrate API reference
5. **Playground Testing**: Verify examples in live playground
6. **Proceed to Phase 9**: AI-Friendly Documentation Enhancement
