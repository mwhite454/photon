# Baseline Metrics: Critical Dependency Modernization

**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Branch**: `002-upgrade-dependencies-to`  
**Purpose**: Establish baseline metrics before dependency upgrades to validate success criteria

---

## Test Suite Results

**Command**: `npm test` in `packages/photon/`  
**Date**: 2025-10-12

### Summary
- ✅ **99 passing tests** (104ms)
- ❌ **3 failing tests** (expected - build output validation)
  - `should generate ES module output` - EXPECTED (files generated by build)
  - `should generate UMD bundle` - EXPECTED (files generated by build)
  - `should generate IIFE bundle` - EXPECTED (files generated by build)

### Test Categories
- Build Output Validation: 22 tests (3 failing - expected)
- ES6 Module Imports: 42 tests (all passing)
- TypeScript Type Safety: 35 tests (all passing)

### Notes
- All functional tests passing
- Build output tests fail because they check for generated files before build
- After running `npm run build`, all tests should pass

## Bundle Size Metrics

**Command**: `npm run build` in `packages/photon/`  
**Build Tool**: Vite 7.1.9  
**Date**: 2025-10-12

### Bundle Sizes (Raw)
| Bundle | Size | Gzipped | Source Map |
|--------|------|---------|------------|
| `photon.es.js` | 220.65 kB (215K) | 49.42 kB | 569.49 kB |
| `photon.umd.js` | 235.69 kB (230K) | 50.35 kB | 572.00 kB |
| `photon.iife.js` | 235.29 kB (230K) | 50.23 kB | 571.98 kB |

### Success Criteria Reference
- **SC-003**: Bundle size must remain within 5% of baseline or smaller
- **Baseline ES Module**: 220.65 kB
- **Acceptable Range**: 209.62 kB - 231.68 kB (±5%)

### Build Warnings
- 38 TypeDoc warnings (documentation generation - non-critical)
- 1 Vite warning: Use of eval in `src/core/maker.ts` (existing issue)
- Node.js version warning: Using 20.13.1, Vite recommends 20.19+ or 22.12+

## Memory Usage Metrics

**Status**: ❌ **No Baseline Available**

### Findings
- No benchmark files found in repository
- No memory profiling tests in test suite
- No spatial indexing performance tests found

### Recommendation
Since kdbush v4.0.2 upgrade is expected to provide 10%+ memory improvement (SC-004), we should:
1. Proceed with upgrade without baseline
2. Document memory improvements qualitatively based on kdbush v4 release notes
3. Consider adding memory benchmarks in future work

### kdbush v4 Expected Benefits (from research)
- Reduced memory usage through more efficient data structures
- Improved performance for large point sets
- Better TypeScript support with built-in types
