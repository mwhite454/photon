# Tasks: Local Development Site Preview & Defect Inventory

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-as-a-photon/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: TDD approach specified in constitution - tests will be written before implementation

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Scripts**: `scripts/` at repository root
- **Server**: `playground-server.js` at repository root
- **Tests**: `tests/defect-discovery/` at repository root
- **Documentation**: `docs/` (Jekyll site)
- **Reports**: `specs/005-as-a-photon/` (generated defect inventory)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure for documentation tooling

- [X] T001 Create `scripts/` directory for documentation tooling scripts
- [X] T002 Create `tests/defect-discovery/` directory for test suite
- [ ] T003 [P] Upgrade Jekyll to latest version (4.4.1)
  - Create `docs/Gemfile` with Jekyll 4.4.1 and required dependencies
  - Add `gem 'jekyll', '~> 4.4.1'`
  - Add `gem 'webrick', '~> 1.8'` (required for Ruby 3.0+)
  - Add any theme gems if needed
  - Run `bundle install` in `docs/` directory
  - Document Ruby version requirement (>= 2.7.0)
- [ ] T004 [P] Verify Jekyll installation and version (`bundle exec jekyll --version`)
- [ ] T005 [P] Verify Playwright is installed (`npx playwright --version`)
- [ ] T006 [P] Create `.gitignore` entries for `docs/_site/`, `docs/.jekyll-cache/`, `docs/Gemfile.lock`, and `specs/005-as-a-photon/screenshots/`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core Jekyll build integration that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until Jekyll build is integrated into the server

- [ ] T007 Create `scripts/jekyll-build.js` - Jekyll build wrapper module
  - Export `buildJekyll()` function that runs `bundle exec jekyll build` in `docs/` directory
  - Return promise that resolves when build completes
  - Capture and format build output for logging
  - Handle build errors with clear error messages
  - Include platform-specific command handling (Windows vs Unix)

- [ ] T008 Modify `playground-server.js` - Integrate Jekyll build on startup
  - Import `buildJekyll()` from `scripts/jekyll-build.js`
  - Run Jekyll build before starting Express server
  - Log build progress and completion time
  - Exit with error if Jekyll build fails
  - Add startup message indicating Jekyll build status

- [ ] T009 Modify `playground-server.js` - Serve `_site` directory instead of `docs`
  - Change `app.use(express.static('docs'))` to `app.use(express.static('docs/_site'))`
  - Update redirect logic for `/docs/*` paths if needed
  - Preserve existing `/packages` and `/api` routes

- [ ] T010 [P] Add file watcher for automatic Jekyll rebuilds
  - Extend existing Chokidar watcher to watch `docs/` directory
  - Exclude `docs/_site/` from watch (avoid infinite loops)
  - Trigger Jekyll rebuild on changes to `.html`, `.md`, `.yml` files
  - Debounce rebuild triggers (wait 500ms after last change)
  - Log rebuild events to console

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - server now builds and serves Jekyll site properly

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Start Local Development Server Successfully (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Fix the local development server to build Jekyll site and serve rendered documentation without errors

**Independent Test**: Start server with `npm start`, navigate to http://localhost:3000/docs/getting-started/, verify rendered content (not raw templates)

### Tests for User Story 1

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (P2): Can start after Foundational - Depends on US1 for working server
  - User Story 3 (P3): Can start after Foundational - Depends on US1 for working server
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Requires US1 complete (needs working server to test styling)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Requires US1 complete (needs working server to crawl)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Core functionality before validation
- Validation before moving to next story
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T003, T004, T005, T006)
- Within US1 tests: T011 and T012 can run in parallel
- Within US2 tests: T017 and T018 can run in parallel
- Within US3 tests: T023 and T024 can run in parallel
- Within US3 implementation: T026, T027, T032 can run in parallel (different files)
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T035, T036, T037, T038, T040)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 3

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 3 together:
Task: "Create test file tests/defect-discovery/crawler.test.js"
Task: "Create test file tests/defect-discovery/inventory-generation.test.js"

# Launch parallel implementation tasks for User Story 3:
Task: "Implement page discovery in scripts/defect-crawler.js"
Task: "Implement defect detection in scripts/defect-crawler.js"
Task: "Implement screenshot capture for defects"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T007-T010) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T011-T016)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test server startup independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready - developers can now preview docs locally

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Server builds and serves Jekyll site
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **MVP ACHIEVED** (working local docs)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Styling validated
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Automated defect discovery
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Sequential Strategy (Recommended)

Due to dependencies, recommend sequential implementation:

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (T001-T010)
2. Complete User Story 1 (T011-T016) - Test and validate
3. Complete User Story 2 (T017-T022) - Test and validate
4. Complete User Story 3 (T023-T034) - Test and validate
5. Complete Polish (T035-T042)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- TDD approach: Write tests first, ensure they fail, then implement
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at each checkpoint to validate story independently
- **IMPORTANT**: These changes are for local development only - production deployment unchanged
- Jekyll build must complete before server starts (blocking operation)
- Defect crawler requires working local server (US1 must be complete)
- Use mcp-playwright tools for browser automation (already available)
