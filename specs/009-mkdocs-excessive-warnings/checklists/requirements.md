# Specification Quality Checklist: MkDocs Warning Remediation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed

### Content Quality Assessment
- Specification focuses on WHAT (warning reduction, quality improvement) and WHY (user experience, maintainability)
- No technical implementation details (no mention of specific tools, scripts, or code changes)
- Written in business language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 10 functional requirements are testable with clear validation criteria
- Success criteria include both quantitative metrics (70% reduction, 100% link fixes) and qualitative measures (zero content loss, improved navigation)
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of implementation approach)
- Each user story has detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases cover key scenarios: unfixable warnings, third-party plugin issues, regression risks, auto-generated content
- Scope is bounded to warning remediation without content removal
- Dependencies implicitly identified (MkDocs build process, existing documentation structure)

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- Four prioritized user stories cover the complete remediation workflow from baseline to configuration fixes
- Success criteria directly measure the outcomes defined in user stories
- Specification maintains clear separation between requirements (what) and implementation (how)

## Notes

This specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase. The feature has:
- Clear baseline metrics (500+ warnings)
- Specific reduction target (70%+)
- Well-defined constraints (no content removal)
- Prioritized user stories that can be implemented independently
- Comprehensive success criteria covering both technical and user experience outcomes
