To depend on Maker.js, run this from the command line:

```bash
npm install makerjs --save
```

---

Then, in your JavaScript, import the modules you need:

```javascript
// Import specific modules (recommended)
import { models, paths, exporter } from 'photon/core';

// Or import all (if needed)
// import * as photon from 'photon/core';
```
