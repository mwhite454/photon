# Specification Quality Checklist: Local Development Site Preview & Defect Inventory

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification focuses on WHAT developers need (working local server, proper styling, automated defect discovery) and WHY (enable local development, validate changes, comprehensive issue tracking) without specifying HOW to implement it. No specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches are mentioned.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 10 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., "within 30 seconds", "100% of pages", "95% of issues"). All user stories have acceptance scenarios defined. Edge cases cover port conflicts, missing assets, broken links, dynamic content, and access restrictions.

3. **Feature Readiness**: The three user stories are prioritized (P1: server startup, P2: correct styling, P3: automated defect discovery) and independently testable. Each story delivers standalone value. Success criteria align with functional requirements and provide clear measurable outcomes.

## Notes

- Specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and actionable
- The scope is well-bounded: fixing local development server issues and creating a defect inventory system
