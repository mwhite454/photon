# Specification Update Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Updated By**: Agent (per user request)  
**Reason**: Include build process repair in upgrade scope

## Changes Made

### User Story 2 - Renamed and Expanded

**Previous**: "Build Process Compatibility"  
**Updated**: "Build Process Repair & Compatibility"

**Key Addition**: Explicitly includes fixing pre-existing build failures as part of the upgrade scope.

### Pre-existing Issues Now In Scope

The specification now explicitly requires fixing these pre-existing issues:

1. **TypeDoc Documentation Generation Failure**
   - **Issue**: Entry points not referenced in tsconfig
   - **Impact**: `npm run docs` fails with "Unable to find any entry points"
   - **Fix Required**: Update TypeDoc configuration and/or tsconfig to properly reference entry points

2. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**
   - **Issue**: @types/node Buffer interface incompatibility in demos and fonts packages
   - **Error**: `Interface 'Buffer' incorrectly extends interface 'Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>'`
   - **Fix Required**: Update @types/node version or adjust TypeScript configuration

3. **Build Process Validation**
   - **Issue**: Cannot validate upgrade success because builds fail in both baseline and post-upgrade
   - **Fix Required**: Ensure all build processes complete successfully

### Updated Functional Requirements

Added new requirements:

- **FR-003**: System MUST fix TypeDoc configuration so that documentation generation completes successfully
- **FR-003a**: System MUST fix TypeScript compilation errors in demos and fonts packages
- **FR-003b**: System MUST ensure all packages in the monorepo build successfully
- **FR-013**: System MUST fix @types/node compatibility issues causing Buffer interface errors
- **FR-014**: System MUST update TypeDoc tsconfig references to include all entry points

Modified existing requirements:

- **FR-004**: Changed from "maintain" to "maintain AND fix pre-existing failures"
- **FR-011**: Changed from "equivalent output" to "complete successfully and produce valid output"
- **FR-012**: Changed from "continue to function" to "execute successfully with exit code 0"

### Updated Success Criteria

Modified success criteria to reflect build repair:

- **SC-003**: Now explicitly includes "including previously broken builds"
- **SC-004**: Changed from "performance within 10%" to "completes successfully (fixing pre-existing failure)"
- **SC-007**: Changed from "equivalent output" to "complete and valid (fixing pre-existing generation failure)"

### Updated Scope Boundaries

Added to "In Scope":

- **Fixing pre-existing TypeDoc configuration issues** (entry points not in tsconfig)
- **Fixing pre-existing TypeScript compilation errors** (demos and fonts packages)
- **Resolving @types/node Buffer interface compatibility issues**

## Rationale

### Why This Change Was Needed

The original specification assumed the build process was working and only needed to be validated post-upgrade. However, the actual state is:

1. **Baseline State**: Build processes are broken
2. **Post-Upgrade State**: Same build processes are still broken
3. **Problem**: Cannot validate upgrade success when builds fail in both states

### Impact on Implementation

**Before Update**:
- Agents would mark build validation tasks as complete even though builds failed
- Rationale: "Same as baseline, not caused by upgrade"
- Result: Upgrade appears successful but project is still broken

**After Update**:
- Agents must fix the build issues as part of the upgrade
- Build validation tasks require exit code 0 (success)
- Result: Upgrade is truly successful with working build process

### Alignment with Project Goals

This change aligns with the project's constitution principles:

- **Test-Driven Development**: Can't properly test if builds don't work
- **Living Documentation**: Can't generate docs if TypeDoc fails
- **Code Quality**: Must address compilation errors
- **User Experience First**: Developers need working build processes

## Next Steps

With the updated specification, the implementation should:

1. **Complete Phase 2** (already done): Upgrade dependencies
2. **Complete Phase 3** (already done): Validate upgrade compatibility
3. **Add Phase 3.5** (NEW): Fix pre-existing build issues
   - Fix TypeDoc configuration
   - Fix TypeScript compilation errors
   - Validate all builds complete successfully
4. **Continue with Phase 4-6**: Configuration migration, new features, final validation

## Files Updated

- `/specs/003-upgrade-lerna-typedoc/spec.md` - Main specification document
  - User Story 2 expanded with pre-existing issues
  - Functional requirements updated (FR-003, FR-003a, FR-003b, FR-013, FR-014)
  - Success criteria updated (SC-003, SC-004, SC-007)
  - Scope boundaries updated to include build repair

## Validation

The updated specification:

- ✅ Maintains focus on WHAT and WHY (not HOW)
- ✅ Remains technology-agnostic in success criteria
- ✅ Provides clear, testable requirements
- ✅ Includes measurable outcomes
- ✅ Addresses the root issue (broken builds prevent validation)
- ✅ Aligns with project constitution principles
