# Specification Quality Checklist: Critical Dependency Modernization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: All checklist items pass.

**Key Findings**:
- Specification clearly identifies the three critical dependencies and their version jumps
- Breaking changes are documented at the requirement level (FR-005, FR-006)
- Success criteria focus on measurable outcomes (test passage, build success, performance metrics)
- Edge cases appropriately identify technical risks without prescribing solutions
- Assumptions section acknowledges dependencies on existing test coverage and build system capabilities

**Ready for Next Phase**: âœ… This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` if additional stakeholder input is needed.
