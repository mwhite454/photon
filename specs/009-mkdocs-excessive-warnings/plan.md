# Implementation Plan: MkDocs Warning Remediation

**Branch**: `009-mkdocs-excessive-warnings` | **Date**: 2025-10-16 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/009-mkdocs-excessive-warnings/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Reduce MkDocs build warnings from 500+ to fewer than 150 (70%+ reduction) through systematic analysis, categorization, and remediation of broken links, missing references, markdown syntax errors, and configuration issues. All fixes must preserve existing documentation content and functionality while improving overall documentation quality and maintainability.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.x (MkDocs tooling), Markdown (documentation content)  
**Primary Dependencies**: MkDocs, MkDocs plugins (Material theme, etc.), Python scripts for automation  
**Storage**: File-based (Markdown files in `docs/` directory)  
**Testing**: MkDocs build validation, link checking tools, markdown linters, before/after content audits  
**Target Platform**: Documentation build system (local and CI/CD)
**Project Type**: Documentation maintenance (scripts + manual remediation)  
**Performance Goals**: Build time should not increase significantly; warning capture should complete within build time  
**Constraints**: Zero content removal, zero broken functionality, all fixes must be reversible  
**Scale/Scope**: 500+ warnings across multiple markdown files in `docs/` directory, targeting 70%+ reduction

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with Photon Constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`):

- [x] **Test-Driven Development**: Validation tests (before/after audits, link checks, markdown linting) will verify fixes before deployment
- [x] **Specification-Driven**: Four prioritized user stories with Given-When-Then acceptance criteria defined in spec.md
- [N/A] **ES6+ Compatibility**: Not applicable - this is documentation maintenance, not library code
- [N/A] **Experiment-Friendly**: Not applicable - no playground changes required
- [x] **User Experience First**: Fixes improve navigation, eliminate broken links, and enhance documentation quality for users
- [x] **Living Documentation**: This feature IS about maintaining living documentation - warnings indicate documentation debt
- [N/A] **CNC/Laser Focus**: Not applicable - infrastructure work supporting all documentation
- [x] **Code Quality**: Python scripts for automation will follow best practices; markdown will be validated with linters
- [x] **Performance Standards**: Build time impact minimized; warning capture integrated into existing build process
- [x] **Versioning**: PATCH version - documentation improvements with no API changes

### Reports and Baselines

├── docs-warnings/
│   ├── categorized-warnings.json # Warnings grouped by type

```

**Structure Decision**: This is a documentation maintenance feature requiring automation scripts for warning capture/analysis, manual remediation of markdown files, and validation reports. No application code changes are needed - all work focuses on the `docs/` directory and supporting Python scripts in `scripts/docs-warnings/`.
