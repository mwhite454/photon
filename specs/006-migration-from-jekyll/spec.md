# Feature Specification: Documentation Migration from Jekyll to MkDocs

**Feature Branch**: `006-migration-from-jekyll`  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Migration from Jekyll to MkDocs with mkdocs-shadcn theme, including documentation translation from snippets to markdown with frontmatter, and Playwright tests for visual verification"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - MkDocs Site Builds and Serves Successfully (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

As a developer, I need the documentation site to build and serve using MkDocs with the mkdocs-shadcn theme so that I can preview documentation locally without Ruby/Jekyll dependencies.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational requirement - without a working MkDocs build, no other migration work can be validated. It establishes the new documentation infrastructure.

**Independent Test**: Run the MkDocs build command and serve the site locally. Navigate to the homepage and verify the mkdocs-shadcn theme is applied with proper styling and navigation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** MkDocs is installed with mkdocs-shadcn theme, **When** I run the build command, **Then** the site builds successfully without errors
2. **Given** the site is built, **When** I start the development server, **Then** the site is accessible at localhost with the shadcn theme applied
3. **Given** the development server is running, **When** I navigate to any documentation page, **Then** the page loads with proper styling, navigation, and theme elements
4. **Given** I make changes to markdown files, **When** I save the changes, **Then** the site automatically rebuilds and reflects the updates

### User Story 2 - All Documentation Content Migrated to Markdown (Priority: P2)

As a documentation maintainer, I need all Jekyll snippets and HTML templates converted to standard markdown files with proper frontmatter so that the documentation content is accessible and maintainable in MkDocs.

**Why this priority**: Content migration is essential for the site to be functional. Without migrated content, the site structure exists but has no usable documentation.

**Independent Test**: Verify that all 71 snippet files and all documentation pages have been converted to markdown format with appropriate frontmatter, and that content renders correctly in MkDocs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Jekyll snippet files exist in `_snippets/`, **When** migration is complete, **Then** all snippets are converted to markdown files with proper frontmatter
2. **Given** Jekyll HTML pages with snippet references exist, **When** migration is complete, **Then** pages are converted to markdown with embedded content from snippets
3. **Given** migrated markdown files, **When** I view them in MkDocs, **Then** code blocks, formatting, and links render correctly
4. **Given** Jekyll liquid tags exist in content, **When** migration is complete, **Then** all liquid syntax is replaced with markdown equivalents or removed

### User Story 3 - Navigation Structure Preserved and Enhanced (Priority: P3)

As a documentation user, I need the site navigation to match or improve upon the existing Jekyll structure so that I can easily find and navigate between documentation sections.

**Why this priority**: Navigation enhances usability but the site can function with basic navigation. This is an improvement over the baseline migration.

**Independent Test**: Compare the navigation structure in the new MkDocs site against the original Jekyll site and verify all sections are accessible and logically organized.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the original Jekyll site has a navigation structure, **When** I view the MkDocs site, **Then** all major sections are present in the navigation
2. **Given** nested documentation sections exist, **When** I navigate the site, **Then** the hierarchy is preserved and breadcrumbs show my location
3. **Given** I am on any documentation page, **When** I use the navigation, **Then** I can access all other documentation pages
4. **Given** the mkdocs-shadcn theme, **When** I view the navigation, **Then** it includes modern UI elements like search, dark mode toggle, and responsive design

---

### User Story 4 - Automated Visual Verification with Playwright (Priority: P4)

As a developer, I need automated Playwright tests that verify the documentation site loads correctly and uses the proper theme so that I can catch visual regressions and deployment issues early.

**Why this priority**: Automated testing provides confidence but is not required for the initial migration. It's valuable for ongoing maintenance and CI/CD integration.

**Independent Test**: Run the Playwright test suite and verify it checks for theme application, page loading, navigation functionality, and visual consistency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Playwright tests are configured, **When** I run the test suite, **Then** tests verify the homepage loads successfully
2. **Given** the test suite runs, **When** tests execute, **Then** they confirm the mkdocs-shadcn theme is applied (check for theme-specific CSS classes or elements)
3. **Given** multiple documentation pages exist, **When** tests run, **Then** they verify each major section loads without errors
4. **Given** theme features exist, **When** tests run, **Then** they verify dark mode toggle, search functionality, and responsive layout work correctly
5. **Given** tests complete, **When** I review results, **Then** screenshots are captured for visual comparison

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a Jekyll snippet contains complex liquid logic that doesn't translate directly to markdown?
- How does the system handle Jekyll includes and layouts that have no direct MkDocs equivalent?
- What happens when code blocks use Jekyll-specific syntax highlighting that differs from markdown?
- How are Jekyll collections (like `_snippets`) represented in the MkDocs structure?
- What happens to Jekyll front matter fields that don't map to MkDocs front matter?
- How are relative links between pages handled during migration to ensure they still work?
- What happens when the mkdocs-shadcn theme has different configuration requirements than standard MkDocs themes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST install and configure MkDocs with the mkdocs-shadcn theme
- **FR-002**: System MUST convert all 71 Jekyll snippet files from HTML to markdown format
- **FR-003**: System MUST convert all Jekyll documentation pages to markdown with proper frontmatter
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve all code examples, syntax highlighting, and formatting during migration
- **FR-005**: System MUST translate Jekyll liquid tags to markdown equivalents or remove them appropriately
- **FR-006**: System MUST create a navigation structure in MkDocs configuration that mirrors the Jekyll site organization
- **FR-007**: System MUST update all internal links to work with the new MkDocs URL structure
- **FR-008**: System MUST configure the mkdocs-shadcn theme with appropriate settings for the Photon documentation
- **FR-009**: System MUST create Playwright tests that verify the site loads and renders correctly
- **FR-010**: System MUST create Playwright tests that verify the mkdocs-shadcn theme is properly applied
- **FR-011**: System MUST integrate MkDocs build into the existing development server workflow
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide migration scripts or tools to automate the Jekyll-to-markdown conversion
- **FR-013**: System MUST preserve all existing documentation content without loss during migration

### Key Entities

- **Documentation Page**: A markdown file representing a single documentation page with frontmatter (title, description, navigation order) and content (text, code examples, links)
- **Snippet**: A reusable documentation fragment that was previously a Jekyll snippet, now embedded directly into markdown pages or referenced via MkDocs includes
- **Navigation Structure**: The hierarchical organization of documentation pages defined in the MkDocs configuration file
- **Theme Configuration**: Settings specific to the mkdocs-shadcn theme including colors, fonts, features, and layout options
- **Playwright Test Suite**: A collection of automated tests that verify site functionality, theme application, and visual consistency
