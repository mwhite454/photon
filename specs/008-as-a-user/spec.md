# Feature Specification: Publish and Verify Latest Photon Docs on GitHub Pages

**Feature Branch**: `008-as-a-user`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "as a user I want to review the latest photon docs on github pages; however the current main branch is incorrectly utilizing outdated documentation and theme. Agents shoulds be able to navigate to the repository pages on github using mcp-playwright, verify the incorrect documentation and fix build process so the modern shadcn based mkdocs is visible when visitors arrive"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - View Latest Documentation on GitHub Pages (Priority: P1)

Visitors can access the Photon documentation site on GitHub Pages and see the latest documentation from the current default branch, with the modern docs theme clearly visible.

**Why this priority**: Ensures users see accurate, current documentation, reducing confusion and support burden.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to the docs site URL and verify visible markers indicating the current version/date and modern theme UI elements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the docs site is published, **When** a visitor loads the homepage, **Then** the page shows the modern docs theme and the latest version metadata.
2. **Given** a new change on the default branch affecting docs, **When** the change is merged, **Then** the docs site reflects the update after publication completes.

---

### User Story 2 - Automatic Publication from Default Branch (Priority: P2)

Documentation builds and publishes automatically when changes are merged into the default branch.

**Why this priority**: Prevents drift between source content and published site.

**Independent Test**: Merge a documentation change; verify a new build runs and the site updates without manual steps.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a commit to the default branch that modifies docs content, **When** CI completes, **Then** the docs site is updated with that change.

---

### User Story 3 - Automated Verification of Theme and Recency (Priority: P3)

An automated check validates that the published site uses the modern theme and reflects the latest content.

**Why this priority**: Early detection of regressions (outdated theme, stale content) improves reliability.

**Independent Test**: Execute an automated browser check that visits the site and asserts presence of specific visual/text markers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the docs site is published, **When** the verification job runs, **Then** it confirms the modern theme is active and core markers are present.

---

### User Story 4 - Handling of Edge Cases (Priority: P4)

The system handles edge cases such as cache delays, broken links, and build/publish failures to ensure a smooth user experience.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the system is robust and provides a good user experience even in unexpected situations.

**Independent Test**: Simulate edge cases and verify the system's response.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a cache delay, **When** the system detects it, **Then** it updates the page with the latest content within a reasonable time window.
2. **Given** a broken link or missing asset, **When** the system detects it, **Then** it reports the issue and allows for retry.
3. **Given** a build succeeds but publish step fails, **When** the system detects it, **Then** it surfaces the failure and allows for retry.

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

- Cache delays cause users to see stale assets after a successful publish; page must display updated content within a reasonable time window.
- Broken links or missing assets post-publish; the process should detect and report them.
- Build succeeds but publish step fails; system should surface failure and allow retry.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The documentation site MUST render the latest documentation from the repository's default branch.
- **FR-002**: The publication process MUST automatically trigger on updates to the default branch and complete without manual steps.
- **FR-003**: The published site MUST display clear markers indicating recency (e.g., build date or version tag) visible on the homepage.
- **FR-004**: The publication process MUST provide logs and status that indicate success/failure of build and publish steps.
- **FR-005**: An automated verification MUST validate that the published site presents the modern docs theme and expected visual/text markers.
- **FR-006**: Hosting configuration MUST use GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions-managed deployment (Pages source set to GitHub Actions).
- **FR-007**: Documentation source directory MUST be `docs/docs/` with configuration at `docs/mkdocs.yml`.
- **FR-008**: Verification MUST assert presence of text/structure markers indicating the modern site: header shows site title "Photon", top navigation includes "Getting Started", search input is visible, and repository link "mwhite454/photon" appears on the page.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Build**: A CI process that transforms source docs into a static site and records outcome (success/failure, logs, duration).
- **Publication**: The action that makes the built site available at the public URL (status, target, timestamp).
- **Verification Check**: An automated run that navigates to the public URL and asserts expected markers.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: From merge to default branch to live site visible update is â‰¤ 10 minutes at p95.
- **SC-002**: 0 occurrences of outdated theme or stale homepage content detected by automated verification over a rolling 30-day period.
- **SC-003**: Automated verification passes on 95% of runs over a rolling 30-day period (excluding upstream outages).
- **SC-004**: Support requests related to "docs outdated/wrong theme" decrease by 80% within one month of release.
